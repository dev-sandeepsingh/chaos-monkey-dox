CircleCI is tool for contineous integration (CI) of your project modules developed. CircleCI controls your deployement acting as gateway to pass, hence helps to automates the software development process.

## Login/Signup

## CircleCI configuration
CiclCI is configured using `config.yml` file generally kept in folder `.cirlceci` in root directory of app/project. complete file relative path is `.circleci/config.yml` .

Sample [.circleci/config.yml](.circleci/config.yml) for laravel project.

Know more about format of config.yml [Sample config.yml Files](https://circleci.com/docs/2.0/sample-config/#section=configuration) 

## Add ENV variables
CircleCI env variables can be used in configuration file to supply credentials or other secret values(can't write on config file directly and push to github). Variables can be added to KEY, VALUE pairs and KEY can be used in config file with prefix $ i.e. $KEY.

You can add ENV variables to CircleCI as below:
1. Goto `WORKFLOWS` from left side Nav.
2. Click on setting icon in front of your project. It will take you to project settings for circle CI.
3. Click on `Environment Variables` under Build Settings from secondary left side nav.
